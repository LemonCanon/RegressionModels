##Introduction

In this analysis I will be looking at the relationship between the factors in the mtcars database. In particular the relationship between mpg in standard and automatic cars.

##Exploritory Analysis

```{r}
#load in the mtcars data
data("mtcars")
str(mtcars)
?mtcars

```
The am variable is the type of trasmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) and the mpg variable is the miles/gallon of the car. I would like to first suppose a linear model where mpg ~ beta0 + beta1*am 

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
fit1$coeff

library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg))
g + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(.~am)

```
